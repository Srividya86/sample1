/*To complete this exercise, correctly implement the rarityOfItems method. This method should perform the following tasks:

Create a dictionary that keeps a count of how many items in the inventory are common, uncommon, rare, and legendary.
For each item in the inventory, determine its rarity and then add one to the running count for that rarity.
Return the dictionary.
